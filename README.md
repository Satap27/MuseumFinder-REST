# MuseumFinder-REST
MuseumFinder-REST is a **RESTful API** that allows the management and retrieval of information relating to a large number of Italian museums.

## Motivations
This project context is my Bachelor research thesis about **migration methodologies from desktop architectures to lightweight web architectures in Java ecosystem**.  
The case study is a Java Desktop application, [Museum Finder](https://github.com/Satap27/MuseumFinder), that provides the same functionalities but with less flexibility.
